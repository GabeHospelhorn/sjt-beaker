# SJT Beaker

**An evaluation vessel for capacity, judgment, and boundary conditions**

---

## Scope

The SJT Beaker is an evaluation vessel, not a model, benchmark, or scoring system.

It is designed to surface how judgment behaves under:
- shifting capacity
- partial information
- boundary pressure
- context change

The beaker does not measure correctness. It reveals where judgment degrades, stabilizes, or collapses.

---

## What This Is

- A structured evaluation environment
- A vessel for observing judgment under constraint
- A way to surface boundary effects without assuming persistence

---

## What This Is Not

- Not a safety guarantee
- Not an alignment claim
- Not a deployment recommendation
- Not a benchmark leaderboard
- Not a call to action

---

## Design Notes

- The beaker does not assume persistence
- Prior responses do not automatically confer standing
- Context is treated as provisional
- Judgment is evaluated per condition, not amortized

---

## Intended Audience

- Evaluation and red-team researchers
- Infrastructure and runtime architects
- Governance and inspection groups
- Security and reliability practitioners

---

## Use

This artifact is published for inspection and experimentation.

It makes no claims beyond what can be observed.
